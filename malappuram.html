         <p class="card-text">Located 2 km from Nilambur town in Malappuram district is the oldest teak plantation in the world. Formed in the 1840s, it is spread across a huge area of 2.31 hectares. It was named after its creator, H.V. Conolly, the collector of Malabar district at the time. Chanthu Menon, who played a major role in developing this plantation, is buried here as well. He organised the hectic task of planting the saplings.

          The oldest teak tree in the world, Kannimari, is located here. The tribals of the area consider it sacred and people regularly flock to this place to look at this natural wonder. It is among the gems of the State’s plantations. At a distance of 4 km from the town lies the world's first Teak Museum. The museum is a sub-centre of the Kerala Forest Research Institute. The ground floor is dedicated to the study of the Kannimara Teak. This species is the oldest naturally growing variant in the country.</p>

         <p class="card-text">The small town of Kottakkal in the Northern district of Malappuram in Kerala is home to Kottakkal Arya Vaidyasala (KAV), the renowned centre for Ayurveda in Kerala. It is one of the pioneering institutions of Ayurveda in Kerala. Started essentially as a village clinic, it has now grown into a multi-unit and multi-disciplinary organization.

          Founded in 1902 by the visionary physician and philanthropist, the late Vaidyaratnam P.S. Warrier, KAV has branches all over Kerala and in other parts of the India, including the capital of India, New Delhi. P.S. Warrier learned Ayurveda under the classical gurukula system and acquired proficiency in the practice of Allopathy also. In 1933, in recognition of his valuable services to humanity, P.S. Warrier was conferred the distinguished title of Vaidyaratna by Viceroy and Governor General of India at that time.</p>
